so many thing to update... I got panicy near the end... so threw a lot away.
Here are some things that can be done given time to make this more awesome:

1. Not everything should be a shared_ptr. Ie. HEAP should not be a 
	shared_ptr. Re-evaluate all shared_ptr types and remove the ptr if it 
	makes sense.

2. Ensure const correctness for all functions... making a shared_ptr const 
	DOES have a meaning, even when passed by value!

3. Make sure all functions can give the highest exception gaurentee.

4.	Make sure the code is AS extensible as possible, so the language can be
	extended.

5.	add List Comprehension.

6.	go through the book and add all WAM optimizations.

7.	go through the code and add any easy optimizations that don't jeopordize
	the niceness of the code in any way.
