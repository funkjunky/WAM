In the definition of the fact:
---
	If it's an arguement then use get, if it's an arguement of an arguement, then use unify... and everything recursively further is also unify.
If you come up to a structure past the first level of arguements, then use a variable and prepare code for the structure to be appended to the instructions for the fact. In the Defn's case use unify_variable or unify_value.


In the body/goals of the fact:
---
	If it's an arguement then use put, if it's an arguement of an arguement, then use set. Everything recursive follows.
If you come up to a structure past the first level of arguements, then use a variable and prepare code for the structure to be appended to the instructions for the fact. In the body's case use set_variable or set_value.
